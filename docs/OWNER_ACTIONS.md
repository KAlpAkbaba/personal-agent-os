# Owner Actions — the live queue

`OWNER_ACTIONS_MINIMAL.md` says which actions are unavoidable in principle. This file says
which one to do **now**, in what order the rest come, and what happens automatically after
each. Everything not listed here is the agent's job.

Rules this file follows:

- one action at a time, with the exact command or click, not a research task;
- an action appears only when the work in front of it is finished and verified, so nothing
  here is waiting on the agent;
- each entry says what it unblocks, so a "not now" is an informed decision rather than a
  guess;
- no secret is ever typed into a chat. Where a value is sensitive, the entry names the local
  tool that takes it (`scripts/secret-store.ps1`, a masked prompt, DPAPI-encrypted, owner-only).

Status vocabulary matches `docs/QUALIFICATION.md`: `PROVEN_REAL`, `PROVEN_PROXY`,
`NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

## Now

**Close the last matrix row: one harmless command, correlated to its audit rows.** Every
runtime and recovery row of the cloud qualification is `PROVEN_REAL`. The one open row -
"agent audit trail records the command" - failed because the *verifier* read the timestamp
from a field named `at`, which the writer has never emitted (it is `ts`); the writer was right.
The reader now correlates by the ACK's own `command_id` + `trace_id`.

Nothing is redeployed, switched, rebooted or disconnected. In an **elevated** PowerShell at
the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\cloud\qualify-cloud.ps1 -BrokerHost 100.90.158.26 -Scenarios audit-only
```

It sends ONE real `desktop.open_application` from the Hetzner broker (Notepad opens and is
closed), then prints the persisted `command_received` + `command_ack` rows carrying that exact
`command_id`/`trace_id`, with the service and companion pids and the rows' `ts`. Send me that
output; the row is closed by the persisted evidence and by nothing less.

## Queue

### 1. Windows Service install — **DONE (2026-09-01)**

Completed and qualified: service LocalSystem/Session 0, companion Session 1, pipe DACL
from the real handle, both restart proofs, final credential rotation. The runtime is
frozen; `docs/QUALIFICATION.md` holds the evidence.

### 2. `gh auth login` — **NOT NEEDED (2026-09-01)**

You were already authenticated, so no action was required. Private repository
`KAlpAkbaba/personal-agent-os` created (visibility confirmed `PRIVATE` before any code left
the machine), `main` pushed, CI running.

The first real CI run immediately earned its keep: it found four environment assumptions the
local gate satisfies by accident — including that `pytest -m "not integration"` was
deselecting **all 1418 tests** and asserting nothing. All four are fixed; see the CI section
in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

### 2b. Install Tailscale on this PC — **DONE (2026-09-01)**

Running, 100.92.148.30 / mail.tail0e6789.ts.net. Criterion 5.2a is PROVEN_REAL: the same
check confirmed the agent still owns no inbound listening socket and no firewall rule
names it.

### 3. Hetzner account + API token — **DONE (2026-09-01)**

Provisioned: server 164238173 (pagentos-core, cpx32, nbg1, running), 100 GB volume,
firewall, SSH key. SKU chosen by the owner after the 15 June 2026 price rise — see
ADR-0033.

### 3b. Break-glass session to finish the tailnet join — **this is the current action**

Unblocks: 5.2b, 5.3, 5.4 and every criterion after them. See **Now** above.

### 4. Bootstrap the owner credential on the real deployment

Unblocks: authenticated use of the deployed system. One command, on the machine hosting the
API, and the credential is shown exactly once:

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap-owner-credential.ps1
```

Put it in your password manager immediately. The server keeps only its SHA-256 hash, the
script writes nothing to disk, and it refuses to run under PowerShell transcription because a
transcript would capture the credential in plaintext. If it is ever lost, rotate on the host
with `.\scripts\bootstrap-owner-credential.ps1 -Rotate`.

### 5. Enroll the owner's browser session

Unblocks: real-browser qualification against sites you are already signed into.

The agent will give you the exact enrollment step when it reaches this point; it needs the
browser closed once, and it never asks for a password.

### 6. Voice provider keys, and recording owner speech samples

Unblocks: real Turkish STT/TTS qualification and speaker enrollment.

Create accounts for the providers that survive the benchmark, then store each key locally —
typed into a masked prompt, encrypted to your Windows account, never in the repository and
never in a chat:

```powershell
.\scripts\secret-store.ps1 -Set PAGENTOS_VOICE_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY
```

Then record several short samples: quiet room, normal office, mildly noisy. The agent will
say exactly how many and how long when it reaches that step.

### 7. A phone

Unblocks: the two mobile criteria that no server-side test can prove — a push arriving on a
locked phone, and microphone capture surviving OS backgrounding.

### 8. Enroll the real assets you authorize for security testing

Unblocks: the Authorized Asset Registry doing anything at all. The registry and its API are
built and tested; what is missing is your actual authorization records, which only you can
make.

## Deferred, not blocking

- Moving the Docker disk image off `C:` (that drive is nearly full). Recommended, not urgent.
- PowerShell 7 — the scripts stay 5.1-compatible on purpose.
