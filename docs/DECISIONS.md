# Architecture Decision Log

Claude must append dated ADR-style entries here.

## ADR-0001 — Hybrid cloud + local device architecture

Status: Accepted

Decision: Cloud core persists tasks/memory/artifacts; Windows agent executes local privileged/interactive actions.

Reason: A pure cloud agent cannot directly and reliably control the owner's Windows desktop without a device-local component.

## ADR-0002 — Native Windows primary development environment

Status: Accepted

Decision: Develop primarily from native Windows Claude Code with Docker/WSL2 for Linux services.

Reason: Windows UI Automation, PowerShell and service/session integration are first-class requirements.

## ADR-0003 — No GPU requirement for initial development

Status: Accepted

Decision: M-1 through initial voice integration must not require a local GPU. GPU is an optional accelerator for local STT/TTS/vision/LLMs.

## ADR-0004 — Hetzner NBG1 initial cloud

Status: Proposed/Accepted for initial implementation, verify SKU before provisioning.

Decision: Use one Nuremberg cloud VM + Nuremberg S3-compatible Object Storage + Tailscale.

## ADR-0005 — Docker Compose before Kubernetes

Status: Accepted

Decision: Kubernetes is not an early milestone dependency.

## ADR-0006 — PostgreSQL is canonical memory/domain store

Status: Accepted

Decision: Use pgvector and optional Mem0 integration; preserve project-owned schemas and exportability.

## ADR-0007 — Deterministic line endings via .gitattributes (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: `* text=auto eol=lf` with CRLF overrides for PowerShell/batch scripts; common media/office formats marked binary.

Reason: The repo is edited on Windows but ships Linux containers and CI; LF-normalized sources keep Docker builds, hashes and diffs reproducible. PowerShell files stay CRLF because Windows PowerShell 5.1 handles CRLF most predictably.

## ADR-0008 — Preflight script hardened against hangs and PATH drift (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: `scripts/preflight.ps1` rewritten to run every external probe through `System.Diagnostics.Process` with a hard timeout, resolve tools via absolute fallback paths, and emit both JSON and a console summary.

Reason: The original version hung indefinitely on this machine (blocked child process, no timeout) and depended on a session PATH that was observed to be incomplete (`System32` missing in spawned shells). A preflight that can hang violates the deterministic-gate principle. Also fixed a latent bug: the old script used `$args` as a function parameter name, which collides with PowerShell's automatic variable.

## ADR-0009 — User-scope toolchain installs, no UAC (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: Missing dev tools are installed user-scope without elevation: `uv` 0.12.7 (winget `--scope user`), `pnpm` 11.24.0 (`npm install -g`, lands in `%APPDATA%\npm`), GitHub CLI 2.98.0 (winget `--scope user`). Deferred: PowerShell 7 (optional; scripts stay 5.1-compatible), .NET SDK (installed user-scope via official `dotnet-install.ps1` when M1 Windows-agent work starts), Tailscale (machine service + login → owner action at M1).

Reason: Keeps M-1 free of UAC interruptions per the owner-experience policy while still making all M0-required tools available. Owner actions are batched in `docs/LOCAL_ENV_REPORT.md`.

## ADR-0010 — M0 language/runtime pinning strategy (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: Python services use `uv` with a project-pinned interpreter (uv-managed CPython, `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), independent of the machine's mixed system Pythons (3.8/3.12/3.14). Node/web workspace uses pnpm with `packageManager` pinning and lockfile. All service dependencies pinned via lockfiles from the first commit.

Reason: The machine has multiple global Pythons; reproducibility must not depend on machine state.

## ADR-0011 — M0 dev infrastructure port scheme and loopback binding (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: The compose project `pagentos` (infra/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml) publishes all services on 127.0.0.1 only, using a 1xxxx host-port scheme to avoid local collisions: PostgreSQL 15432, Redis 16379, MinIO 19000/19001 (API/console), Temporal 17233 (gRPC) and 18233 (UI). Images pinned: pgvector/pgvector:pg16, redis:7-alpine, minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-04-22T22-12-26Z, temporalio/auto-setup:1.27.2, temporalio/ui:2.34.0. Temporal shares the pgvector PostgreSQL instance with its own `temporal`/`temporal_visibility` databases (auto-setup).

Reason: 5432 is occupied by a locally installed PostgreSQL and 8000 by wslrelay on this machine; loopback-only binding enforces the "never expose infra publicly" network rule from day one. Dev credentials (pagentos/pagentos-dev, minioadmin) are dev-only, documented in .env.example, and never valid outside the local loopback stack.

## ADR-0012 — Health checks use sync DB driver in a worker thread (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: `/v1/system/health` probes PostgreSQL with the synchronous psycopg driver via `asyncio.to_thread` instead of SQLAlchemy's async psycopg support.

Reason: psycopg async mode requires a selector event loop; uvicorn on Windows runs the Proactor loop, which made the async DB check fail (`InterfaceError`) even with a healthy database. The threaded sync probe is loop-agnostic and behaves identically in Linux containers.

## ADR-0013 — Web shell stack pinning (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: apps/web uses Next.js 16.3.3 + React 19.2.8 + TypeScript 7.0.2, managed by pnpm 11.24.0 in a root workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, single root `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Exact versions pinned in package.json. The M0 shell is a single client page that polls `/v1/system/health` (default base `http://127.0.0.1:8001`, override via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`) and renders per-dependency status with a graceful "API unreachable" state, tr locale.

Reason: Architecture doc mandates Next.js/React pinned during M0; latest stable resolved at implementation time and locked for reproducibility.

## ADR-0014 — Device broker is a module of the api service (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: The M1 device broker lives inside `services/api` as `app/broker/` (REST routes + WS endpoint + presence/dispatch), not as a separate process. `services/device-broker/` documents the pointer. Separation into its own service happens only when scale or isolation demands it.

Reason: One process, one DB, one migration chain and one health surface make the M1 vertical slice deterministic and avoid premature microservices (constitution: the owner is not an operator; fewer moving parts to keep healthy).

## ADR-0015 — .NET 10 LTS user-scope for the Windows agent (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: Windows Device Agent targets .NET 10 LTS (SDK 10.0.400 pinned via `global.json`), installed user-scope via the official `dotnet-install.ps1` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\dotnet` (no UAC). Architecture: `PagentOS.DeviceService` (background, Windows-Service-capable) + `PagentOS.SessionCompanion` (interactive session) + authenticated local named pipe, per the Windows Agent rule. In development both run as console processes; actual service installation requires UAC and is deferred as an owner action.

Reason: Architecture doc prescribes .NET current LTS and the service/companion split; user-scope install keeps the no-UAC policy intact.

## ADR-0016 — Device identity and protocol v1 choices (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: Device identity is an ECDSA P-256 keypair generated on-device (SPKI public key registered at enrollment; signature over `nonce||device_id` at WS handshake). Enrollment uses single-use, 15-minute, SHA-256-hashed tokens. Transport is agent-initiated outbound WebSocket with JSON frames validated against `packages/schemas/device-protocol.schema.json`; delivery is at-least-once with agent-side idempotency (persistent `idempotency_key -> terminal ack` store), giving effectively-once execution. Error taxonomy extends `docs/API_AND_PROTOCOLS.md` with `command_expired` and `cancelled`. Full contract: `packages/protocol/DEVICE_PROTOCOL.md`.

Reason: P-256/SHA-256 is native to both .NET and Python `cryptography`; Ed25519 support in .NET still requires third-party packages. At-least-once + idempotency is the standard robust choice for command delivery over flaky links and satisfies the retry-must-not-duplicate rule.

## ADR-0017 — Windows agent implementation choices (2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision:
- Agent signs handshake with DER (RFC 3279) ECDSA signatures; broker accepts DER and raw P1363, so both encodings are protocol-legal.
- Private key: unencrypted PKCS#8 PEM in the agent data dir (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\PagentOS\agent` in dev) with NTFS ACL restricted to the current user; DPAPI/TPM hardening deferred to a later milestone per protocol §2.
- Service↔companion IPC: named pipe `pagentos-companion-{user-SID}`, PipeSecurity current-user-only, single instance, newline-delimited JSON internal messages (not part of the device protocol).
- Idempotency store: single JSON file, LRU 1000, atomic temp+move writes; terminal ack persisted before send so lost sends are recovered by broker redelivery; corrupt store quarantined to `.corrupt` and restarted empty.
- `devices/windows-agent/NuGet.config` pins nuget.org because the machine has no configured NuGet source.
- Presence tracking is process-local in the broker (valid single-process; revisit if broker scales out). Broker DB access is sync SQLAlchemy in `asyncio.to_thread` (same Proactor-loop rationale as ADR-0012).

Reason: Each choice keeps the M1 slice deterministic and reversible while matching the two-process Windows architecture rule; hardening steps that need UAC or new infrastructure are explicitly deferred, not skipped silently.

## ADR-0018 — Browser agent semantics (M2, 2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted

Decision: `services/browser` (Python 3.12, Playwright 1.62.0 pinned) is the runtime browser adapter, enforcing the semantic-control hierarchy at the type level: `TargetSpec` expresses role+name / text / label / placeholder / test-id only — CSS, XPath and coordinates are not expressible in the public API. Two session routes: `launch_dedicated()` (managed Chromium) and `connect_existing_cdp()` (existing-session route, E2E-tested against a throwaway Chromium with `--remote-debugging-port`; attaching the owner's real Edge/Chrome is documented for a later milestone via companion-managed loopback CDP or an extension bridge). Typed `BrowserError(error_class, retryable, evidence)` maps Playwright failures onto the project taxonomy (resolve-phase timeout → `ui_target_not_found`; actionability/race failures → `ui_state_changed`, retryable; connection failures → `dependency_unavailable`, retryable). `with_retry` retries retryable classes only and preserves the original error_class on exhaustion (annotating attempts in evidence) — collapsing to `retry_exhausted` is the orchestrator's job, which owns the whole task retry budget. Ambiguous locators resolve `.first` and report `match_count` instead of strict-mode errors. A single `escape_hatch_click_xy` exists as an explicitly warning-logged last resort; it is not reachable via `TargetSpec` and is exercised by exactly one marked fallback test. Playwright MCP remains development-time tooling, distinct from this runtime adapter.

Reason: Implements the constitution's browser rule (highest semantic surface, coordinates last resort) as API shape rather than convention, and keeps retry-budget ownership in one place.

## ADR-0019 — Browser backend adapter model and owner-browser enrollment (M2 delta, 2026-08-31)

Status: Accepted (owner architecture directive)

Decision:
- A `BrowserBackend` adapter interface separates transport from semantics. Backends: `ManagedBackend` (Playwright-managed dedicated/persistent profile — CI, fixtures, deterministic E2E; zero dependency on owner browser state), `ExistingSessionBackend` (attach to an already-running owner Chrome/Edge preserving logins/cookies/tabs/extensions), and a future `VisualFallbackBackend` (explicitly separate adapter; never mixed into the semantic engine). Higher-level browser commands are transport-agnostic.
- Owner-browser attachment is modeled as **browser enrollment**: an explicit authorization record (browser identity, transport, granted capability set) created once by the owner, analogous to device enrollment — never ad-hoc debug-port exposure. The enrollment transport for the real owner browser is a companion-managed loopback attach (extension bridge or supported channel mechanism when it ships); raw `--remote-debugging-port` against the owner's default profile is NOT the production dependency and any CDP endpoint must remain loopback-only. In M2 the existing-session backend is exercised against throwaway browsers.
- Every backend declares a `BrowserCapabilities` record: `authenticated_session`, `downloads`, `uploads`, `extensions`, `existing_tabs`, `multiple_windows`, `visual_fallback` — queryable by the orchestrator before dispatching work.
- A browser-command layer adds cancellation and idempotency (command_id/idempotency-key dedup) mirroring device-protocol semantics, so browser work is safely retryable end to end.
- Semantic priority remains `API/structured data -> DOM/role/accessibility -> text/semantic locator -> browser-level action`; coordinates stay prohibited in the M2 layer.

Reason: Deterministic tests must never depend on (or endanger) the owner's live browser; the owner path needs session preservation and explicit authorization; a stable adapter seam lets transports evolve (extension bridge, visual fallback) without rewriting agent logic.

Implementation addendum (2026-08-31): dead-endpoint navigation types as `dependency_unavailable` (retryable, `net::ERR_*` marker rule); cancellation is a recorded terminal state — duplicates of a cancelled command replay `cancelled` without re-execution (mirrors ADR-0017 idempotency semantics); iframe addressing is semantic-only (`frame="<name>"`, injection-rejecting); `ManagedBackend` rejects profile paths inside real Chrome/Edge/Chromium/Brave `User Data` trees as defense-in-depth; `EnrollmentRegistry` is in-process/file-backed in M2 with broker/DB persistence and the owner approval flow explicitly deferred; closing the last tab is refused (`validation_error`) in favor of closing the session.
